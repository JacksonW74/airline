"# airline" 

This is the Springboot final project for Promineotech backend course.

This application is presented as simplified airline management tool. In this case it is about one airline, that may have other airline entities underneath the corporate umbrella. Example Said Airline (passenger service), Said Aerospace (Provides heavy maintenance for Said Airline), and SaidBox (cargo service).
This application tracks aircraft, routes, employees, customers and stations for the airlines through OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships and 3 seperate join tables.
