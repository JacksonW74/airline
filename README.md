This is it, after 18 weeks of intense bootcamp. This is the final project. A springboot application for airline management application.
Airline entity for tracking the different airlines, airlineId 1 is the corporate entity that overseas other airline entities.
Aircraft entity, Many aircraft to each airline entity. Each aircraft with many employees assigned to them.
Employee entity, Many employees assigned to many airlines.
JoinTable tracks airlineId and employeeId

All tables have full crud capability (with some proper direction of course).

I want to give a special thanks to Michael and Prashant who was there to help get me to this point. I want everyone to know that he is killing it. Thank you Michael. Thank you Prashant.
